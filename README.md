# South Africa Conservation Data Management System 
---
### PROJECT OVERVIEW 
This project aims to assist South Africa Conservation in establishing a robust and efficient database system. By developing comprehensive Entity Relationship (ER) and Enhanced Entity Relationship (EER) diagrams, the project provides a structured approach to organizing and 
managing their data. Upon completion, the society will benefit from a well-designed and clean database system capable of storing and maintaining all essential data. Additionally, logical transformations will be implemented to ensure the database aligns with the organizationâ€™s
operational needs, enhancing data integrity and usability.

## Features
- **Entity Relationship Diagram (ER):** Provides a structured design for the database.
- **Enhanced Entity Relationship Diagram (EER):** Expands the ER model with additional relationships and constraints.
- **Logical Transformation:** Converts the diagrams into detailed database tables with primary and foreign keys.

## File Structure 
- [**Case Background**](https://github.com/SueTan309/South-Africa-Conservation-Data-Management-System/blob/master/Case%20Background%20.pdf): The case background file provides a comprehensive overview of the South Africa Conservation Society, detailing the organization's current data management system and operational structure.
   It highlights the challenges associated with their existing processes and offers insights into the requirements for transitioning to a robust and efficient database framework. This document serves as a foundational reference for understanding the society's needs and objectives, ensuring that the proposed database solution aligns
  with their conservation goals.
- [**ER + EER Diagram**](https://github.com/SueTan309/South-Africa-Conservation-Data-Management-System/blob/master/ER%20%2B%20EER%20Diagram%20.pdf): The file contains comprehensive sketches of the fully developed Entity Relationship (ER) and Enhanced Entity Relationship (EER) diagrams for the South Africa Conservation Society.
   These diagrams visually represent the database structure, including entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints. They serve as a detailed blueprint for designing a robust and efficient database system tailored to the organization's data management and operational requirements.
- [**Logical Transformation**](https://github.com/SueTan309/South-Africa-Conservation-Data-Management-System/blob/master/Logical%20Transformation.pdf): It translates the conceptual database designs into a structured set of tables, complete with primary and foreign key definitions. This transformation ensures that the database is
   fully normalized and ready for implementation, providing a clear and systematic approach to organizing and managing the society's data.
